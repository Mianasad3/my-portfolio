          To commence, my name is Muhammad Asad Ullah. I grew up in Pakistan and
          currently living in Winnipeg MB, Canada. Traditionally, Pakistani
          families are patriarchal and patrilineal. In this way, the senior male
          is the head of the household, followed by the senior female, and
          finally, the children. Furthermore, my interest has been in building
          websites ever since I got to know the procedure or coding behind them.
          So, I chose the software developer program in winter 2021. I have an
          urge to learn new things and new coding styles.

          Lastly, in my free time I prefer to learn more coding skills. As I was
          an international badminton player back home, I tried to gather my
          friend and go to play badminton. It is my dream to represent my
          country in the Olympics.

        <p class="about-para">
          Besides all that, I love to travel and explore nature. I have
          travelled to numerous number of northern area's in Pakistan. Every
          area has different cultures but I have seen humanity and humility of
          them towards travellers, and they provide best service, and now it's
          time to explore the world.
