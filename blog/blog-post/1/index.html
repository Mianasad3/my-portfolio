        <p>
          First of all, I would like to tell you that I am an international
          badminton player. I am the holder of numerous titles. Badminton
          depends upon techniques and physique. This game involves the movement
          of every muscle of your body, which makes you fit and decreases the
          level of ‘bad’ diseases in your body.
        </p>
        <p class="my-1"><b>Badminton is based on following rules: </b></p>
        <ol class="pl-1">
          <li>3 set game.</li>
          <li>Each set contains 21 points</li>
          <li>Each set has an interval after 11 points</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mt-3"><b>Strategy</b></p>
        <p>
          I am an attacking player, though attack requires a lot of arm force.
          Your muscles should be strong enough for attack; your jump, arm force
          and speed matters. With the speed you hit the smash, the defender will
          defend it at the same speed so your speed should be fast enough to
          pick up the shuttle. But the benefit of a strong smash is it doesn't
          allow the opposite player to defend. Smash should be placed on the
          right spot at the right time.
        </p>
        <img
          class="blog-img"
          src="../../../assets/badminton1.png"
          alt="Badminton-Img1"
        />
        <p>
          Highlighted areas in the image show where you can place your smash.
          Players will always be standing in the middle of the court, so if you
          place your smash in the corners it will be difficult for the opposite
          players to defend back.
        </p>

        <p>
          To hit a power smash you need to follow the body language shown in the
          picture. Take your racket to extreme back; then match your time with
          shuttle; make a jump and smash the shuttle to the opponent's court.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3"><b>Tips and Tricks</b></p>
        <p>So here are some tips you need to get strong on.</p>

        <p></p>
        <ol class="pl-1 my-1">
          <li>Improve your footwork.</li>
          <li>Improve your agility.</li>
          <li>Devise your game strategy.</li>
          <li>Learn advanced techniques.</li>
          <li>Improve your stamina.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          By following these tips you can become a good player. Your brain
          should be active enough to place your shots and to confuse opponents.
          Your body language should scare your opponent which will make him lose
          confidence. In the end, I would like to elaborate a little bit more
          about the shots you can play according to your convenience.
